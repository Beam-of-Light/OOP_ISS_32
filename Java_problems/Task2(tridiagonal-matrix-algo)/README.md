In this project implemented two sided and simple Thomas algorithm (also known as Tridiagonal matrix algorithm). 


This algorithm is used to solve linear equations systems with tridiagonal matrix of coefficients. 


To create system of equations you should pass list of values in diagonals of tridiagonal matrix from bottom to top and list of right side system values. 

To calculate the result - you should call method getResult() from created system of equations. If you pass true to the method parallel version will be performed.
