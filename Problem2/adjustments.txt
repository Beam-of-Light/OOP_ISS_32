1)I was supposed to use System.arraycopy() instead of manual element copy(in Tridiagonal matrix constructor).
	Decided to move from double[] arrays to List<Double>. Because of that I don't need to copy elements, just to pass the reference on List
	in constructor.
2)Created new class Main where I have my main function. Deleted the main function from LinearEquations class.
3)Pass the copy constructor of TridiagonalMatrix into the LinearEquations constructor(insted of passing the same matrix).
4)Moved changeCoefficient() into new class Utils.(Moved from TridiagonalMatrix class)
5)Created new function addLastDVectorCoeff() in order to get rid of two repeated lines in my code.
6)Added logging instead of System.out.println().
7)Removed sleep() methods. Substitute it with wait() and notify() methods. Added synchronized keyword to eliminateLowerDiagonalMultiThread().
